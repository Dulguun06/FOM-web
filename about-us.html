        <h2>About us</h2>
        <p>
          Friends of Mongolia (FOM) is organized and operated exclusively for
          charitable, educational, and developmental purposes. Our mission is to
          develop partnerships with the people of Mongolia in furtherance of
          cultural exchange and human development. In fulfillment of this
          mission, our membership and fundraising supports the core programs,
          listed below, that contribute to the future of Mongolia.
          <br />
          FOM was founded by volunteers, and it has remained a
          volunteer-operated organization ever since. Membership was and still
          remains open to all people with an interest in cultural and
          educational exchange between the United States and Mongolia. Current
          members include returned Peace Corps Volunteers, individuals from the
          private sector, people who have served in the diplomatic corps, and
          those who have an interest in or family connections to Mongolia.
          <br />
          The Board of Directors advise Friends of Mongolia, and Officers manage
          day-to-day operations. Both the Board and Officers are elected by FOM
          members, and all serve as volunteers without salary. A Country Program
          Representative is appointed by the board to coordinate activities in
          Mongolia.
          <br />
          FOM is incorporated in the United States of America as a 501(c)( 3)
          nonprofit organization, conducting activities in both Mongolia and the
          United States. It is also affiliated with the
          <a href="https://www.peacecorpsconnect.org/"
            >National Peace Corps Association</a
          >, but Friends of Mongolia membership is open to anyone with an
          interest in Mongolia.

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          Friends of Mongolia was founded in 1999 by a group of volunteers who
          had served in the Peace Corps in Mongolia. At the time, Mongolia had
          only recently established diplomatic relations with the United States,
          and these newly returned volunteers were from the seventh and fifth
          annual "class" of Peace Corps Mongolia volunteers, also known as the
          "M-7's" and "M-5's." These volunteers fell in love with Mongolia and
          its people, and they founded the organization to help others connect
          with Mongolia and contribute to the country's future.
        </p>
        <image src="about-us-image2" alt="About Friends of Mongolia"></image>

        <h2>Operating Model</h2>
        <p>
          Friends of Mongolia relies almost exclusively on support from
          volunteers to initiate and administer programs. Most of FOM's expenses
          fund programs that take place in Mongolia, and we depend on members
          and donors to fund these operations. FOM periodically conducts
          activities in the United States which are focused on cultural exchange
          or connecting members, and these activities are either very low cost
          or simply require a donation of time from our Board and Officers.
        </p>
        <image src="about-us-image3" alt="About Friends of Mongolia"></image>

        <h2>Strategic Goals and Programs</h2>
        <p>
          Friends of Mongolia operates in three strategic areas that reflect
          FOM’s mission of promoting cultural exchange and human (or community)
          development. These areas are Education, Community Development, and
          Community Outreach. Each category is comprised of one or more programs
          with explicit objectives that connect back to FOM’s mission.

          Friends of Mongolia Officers manage its day-to-day operations. These
          officers serve without salary as volunteers, and they are elected by
          FOM members. The organization is governed by a Board of Directors.
          Board members are elected by FOM members, serve three-year terms, and
          may be re-elected. FOM is largely operated by volunteers; there is
          currently an in-country Mongolian Program Representative who receives
          a small stipend.

          funds are utilized in keeping with FOM's public service mission. The
          Board of Directors and the Officers meet via teleconference monthly.
          Members, as well as interested individuals, are encouraged to join
          these meetings.

          have the authority to form committees and appoint individuals to
          supervise particular official duties. Those interested in contributing
          to FOM's mission by volunteering in an official capacity should
          contact one of the Officers about either becoming an Officer or
          working to further FOM's growth as an organization. Working for FOM is
          professionally rewarding and allows volunteers to acquire important
          skills while contributing to Mongolia's development and increasing
          understanding between the Mongolia and the United States.
