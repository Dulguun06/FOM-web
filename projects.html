          <h2>About our scholarship</h2>
          <p>
            The Friends of Mongolia Scholarship Program was established in the
            spring of 2006 and has since grown to better serve the community.
            Our program targets applicants from rural areas with high academic
            potential and financial need who want to attend university in
            Mongolia. In the 2013-2014 school year, Friends of Mongolia helped
            19 students attend university.
            <br />
            For rural families struggling to make ends meet, the prospect of
            sending a child to the capital city of Ulaanbaatar to attend
            university can be out of reach. Friends of Mongolia scholarships are
            provided on an annual basis, and students may apply to have their
            scholarships renewed if they have kept up with the academic
            requirements. We underwrite all or nearly all of each student's
            tuition, depending on the tuition rates of the student's university.
            Throughout the academic year, we provide extra activities to help
            with our students' development. Past activities include career
            development lectures and English language lessons for students.

          <h2>Matthew Girvin Scholarship Fund</h2>
          <p>
            Many of our scholarships are given under the Matthew Girvin
            Scholarship Fund, managed by Innovia Foundation.
            https://innovia.org/our_stories/scholarship-fund-opens-the-path-to-college-for-underprivileged-mongolian-students/
            <br />
            This fund was created in memory of Matthew Girvin, a UNICEF program
            officer who worked for the development of Mongolia's children,
            health, and future. Matthew was killed in a tragic helicopter crash
            in Mongolia in January of 2001. UNICEF established a scholarship in
            Matthew's honor in 2003, and in 2006 Friends of Mongolia began
            administering the scholarship. Our organization is honored to be
            able to have the chance to assist Girvin family with this important
            scholarship, and we look forward to working with them to honor
            Matthew's legacy for years to come. You can find out more about
            Matthew Girvin and the fund at the
            <a href="https://www.matthewgirvin.org/"

          <h2>Other Scholarship Funds</h2>
          <p>
            Friends of Mongolia has also administered scholarships sponsored by
            members and donors. For the 2013-2014 academic year, the Croft
            Family Scholarships enabled students from the Gobi desert to attend
            university in the capital. In the past, groups have also joined
            together to underwrite one or more scholarships. If you are
            interested in funding a scholarship, you can do so on our
            <a href="membership.html">Donation Webpage</a>, or you can email
            treasurer@friendsofmongolia.org or
            codirector.usa@friendsofmongolia.org
          </p>

          <h2>Scholarship History</h2>
          <p>
            When our scholarship program was first formed, it was open to young
            male students. The reason for this unique requirement was what is
            referred to as "Mongolia's reverse gender gap" in education. Often,
            rural males are left behind in education because of social and
            economic demands in the countryside. As the scholarship has grown
            significantly it is now open to all genders, with emphasis for
            students with financial hardships otherwise unable to afford
            college.

          <h2>About CDGs</h2>
          <p>
            The Friends of Mongolia Community Development Grant program provides
            financing for small community-based projects in Mongolia and the
            United States that further education, cultural exchange, and
            community development between both countries. These grants provide a
            small amount of funding that can go a long way do to things like
            repair a school, start market gardens, upgrade a community IT
            center, and support women in small businesses.
            <br />
            Community projects generally do not attract the kind of funding on
            offer from large multi-lateral or bi-lateral donors, and modest
            community-based programs struggle to find appropriate funding to
            support their program goals. The FOM Community Development Grant
            program is intended to address these issues. This program was
            inspired by the Small Project Assistance (SPA) grant program that
            has been used by many Peace Corps Volunteers to help their
            communities. The Friends of Mongolia grant program began in 2006
            with a grant to the National Center Against Violence and a 2007
            grant to the Gobi Radio Project. All FOM Community Development
            Grants are community initiated and implemented.

          <h2>Apply for a Grant</h2>
          <p>
            Proposals are accepted during the application period, and each
            proposal is reviewed by a committee made up of Friends of Mongolia
            Members using a standard scoring method. Final funding approval for
            proposals is made based on review committee recommendations and the
            availability of funds. Each proposal should demonstrate
            community-based support for a project through a minimum 25% local
            in-kind contribution of labor and materials to the overall budget of
            the project. While there is no limit for how much an application can
            request, historically Friends of Mongolia has awarded grants of
            $1000 or less, as to approve as many proposals as possible.

          <h2>About Community Outreach</h2>
          <p>
            One of Friends of Mongolia's goals is to reach out and educate as
            many as possible about the beautiful country and people of Mongolia.
            We take this extra step because we believe that through this
            education and outreach, invaluable understanding and relationships
            are built between our two great countries. While this is a small
            portion of our budget, it allows our outreach events to have a wide
            reach.If you have a great idea for a potential outreach opportunity,
            let us know at admin@friendsofmongolia.org.
